CDCrest simulates the MEC execution environment based on WS-Dream dataset, including both normal operation and scenarios where concept drift occurs.
CDCrest use the sliding window to obtain and represent the distribution features of the up-to-date data stream online, and then accurately sample the massive historical reliability data stream to obtain the distribution characteristics of the historical data. 
Then, CDCrest judge whether there is an anomaly currently occurring according to the distribution difference between the two. After an anomaly is detected, edge service rejuvenation will be executed to guarantee the stability of the edge service.
